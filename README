So, let's try to get some neural network predict the euro tournament.

To train the network, we need historic data

https://www.oddsportal.com/soccer/europe/euro-2012/results/

Let's put that in a csv (4 csv ?) and see where we come.

So the content comes from a json call.
Let's save the payload in the docs dir.
And remove the extra stuff.
Leave only the html string.

Iterate over the lines and extract the data.
Hours, Day, Participants, Score are easy to extract.

The odd seems to be encoded in an own cipher.
The decoding must happen in js in browser.
Either it's a lookup table, or there is some trick.
At least they stay constant upon refresh of the page.

So there is always an 'f' in the middle, and often a 'z' on both side.
The z could stand for '.', and maybe only the part after the 'f' is relevant.
Okay, we have two values there: the max amoung the brokers (first part) and the mean (the second part).
It's some simple substitution code.

Refactor the code to process all the data, and generate csv.
