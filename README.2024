Let's try again!

This time, maybe not by first trying Deep Reinforcement Learning, and then falling back to some linearity, without any AI background.

I just finished Chapter 13 of "Grokking Neuronal Network and Deep Learning".
So I could actually just write some easy network, some that train their weights under a minute on a CPU.
I actually don't think we need more here.

What data do we have?
Do we actually have all the 2020 results at least?
Last match is 11.07, that was the final, okay, that's good.

So, 2024, Qualifying and so and missing.

And the FIFA Dataset moved to there: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashncarry/fifaworldranking
Ouch, I just got lost there: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sslp23/predicting-fifa-2022-world-cup-with-ml

Okay, but I want some deep-learning.
I want a Neuronal Network, and not some 'sklearn' magic like that guy.
He's probably very talented, and can filter beforehand (or know how to decide if filter).
I want my network to learn what combination of the features is meaningful, and build them on the fly.

What I'm not sure about a the moment, is all those features that relies on past data (like average goals 3, 5, 15) ...
While that could be built on an RNN. that would either require the historical data to be provided for each prevision, or, that would require a new training for each match (in which case we don;t require a RNN),.

On the other hand, I dont believe that one model can consistently predict the whole EM.
The performance of the teams is evolving during the tournament.

So, what features do I have at hand:

* date
* home team
* away team
* kind (qualification, friendly, playoff, ...)
* score
* {max, mean}_odd_{home, draw, away}

Plus some FIFA ranking:
* country
* rank
* rank_change
* rank_date

So, it seems, a match is not "easily" a snapshot in time, it has influence from the past matches.
So, what historical data would we like to have?
* means goals of the team
* means goals suffered by the team

I got why I missed that historical aspect thingy.
Ideally, I wanted to have the teams be one of the feature of the input dataset, and that way have a model that knows how each team is playing.
That actually is not very correct, as, say, the albanian team from 1996, doesn't have much in common with the albanian team from 2024.
That **could** still be a feature, but linked to the mentality / character of the  team, not its performance.

Oddsportal changed their backend, It seems I had not all the 2020 data.
So, get our hands dirty first.

---

I believe the system is inherently wrong.
After minutes of training, it always predicts 2:1.

I should try with the real scores instead of total, delta.
Or maybe with ratio instead of delta ?

Well, the ratio stuff didn't changed much.

Maybe my features don't allow for a better prediction.

---

I train my model on qualification matches.
THose are NOT neutral, and take place in one of the competing countries.
That is completely different to what happens in the competition.
Hence the 2:1 favorite predicted score.
Sadly, I cannot really remove the 'home' advantage from my features.
So -> My training data has no correlation to the  evaluation data.
EndOfGame.
